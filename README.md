sashimi UI is a minimal CSS framework designed to enhance, not replace, the **native capabilities of HTML**.  
It styles elements such as `<a>;`, `<button>;`, and `<input>;` without unnecessary wrapping or abstraction.  
By embracing the **natural behavior of the web**, sashimi UI lets the platform shine in its purest form.
