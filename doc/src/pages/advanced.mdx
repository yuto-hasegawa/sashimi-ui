## React components

sashimi UI is built around plain HTML by design.  
However, if you are using React, you can take advantage of dedicated components to make the most of it.  
  
sashimi UI React components add **useful behaviors** to standard HTML elements.  
They only enhance functionality â€” **no extra markup or wrapper elements** are introduced.  

<SamplePane >
  <DialogUsagePopover client:only="react"/>
</SamplePane>

```jsx
<button ref={buttonRef} className="button" type="button" onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>
  Menu
</button>
<Dialog mode="popover" open={open} anchor={buttonRef.current} onClickAway={() => { setOpen(false); }}>
  <ul style={{ listStyle: "none", padding: 0 }}>
    {/* Menu items */}    
  </ul>
</Dialog>
```

For example, the `<Dialog/>` component makes it possible to control the native `<dialog/>` element declaratively.  
Normally, a `<dialog/>` can only be opened imperatively with the element.showModal() method.  
With the open prop, you can manage its state directly in React, making it easier to work with.  
You can also specify an anchorEl to position it like a menu.    

**A `<Dialog/>` component always renders a single `<dialog>` element**, nothing more.<br/>
